# Mesh Networking Spec (Draft)

**Status:** Draft

## Goal

Document the mesh networking assumptions *after* Phase 2B’s routing model is chosen.

## Design gate dependency

This spec depends on the explicit routing model decision in `docs/phases/PHASE_2B_REMOTE_OPERATION.md`.

## Notes

Until the routing model is chosen, avoid building a wide mesh abstraction layer.
