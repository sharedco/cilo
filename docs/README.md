# Cilo Documentation

Welcome to the Cilo technical documentation. We have consolidated our docs into three high-utility files to keep our knowledge base as lean as our code.

## 核心文档 (Core Docs)

1.  **[Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md)**
    *   Learn how Cilo uses isolated subnets, non-destructive overrides, and atomic state management to create high-fidelity environments.
2.  **[Operations & Maintenance](./OPERATIONS.md)**
    *   Setup instructions, troubleshooting with `cilo doctor`, and manual uninstallation procedures.
3.  **[Future: Remote & Mesh Networking](./REMOTE_NETWORKING.md)**
    *   Our vision for multi-remote networking, workspace synchronization, and cross-host container communication.
